ansible ad hoc command to copy directory - Local to remote

This is an ansible AD HOC command to copy a directory to the remote server
ansible testserver -m copy -a "src=~/Downloads/logos dest=/var/www/html/ owner=apache group=apache mode=0644 " -i ansible_hosts -b

You need to notice that there is no / at the end of src path. It is just ~/Downloads/logos

If you put a slash at the end. It would copy only the contents of the directory alone but not the directory.
