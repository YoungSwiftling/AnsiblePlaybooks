ad hoc command to display memory, cpu and OS distribution and version

Here we have given a Ansible Ad hoc command to display system information like memory, cpu etc.

we have used Ansible setup module with filter  to select necassary attributes of a system.

to know more about what other ansible_facts or variables you can possibly use in this filter. read our detail article on ansible facts

But this ad hoc command would help you solve things up.

$ ansible linux -m setup -i ansible_hosts -a 'filter=ansible_distribution,ansible_distribution_version,ansible_memfree_mb,ansible_memtotal_mb,ansible_processor_cores*,ansible_architecture' 2>/dev/null


10.0.4.26 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
        "ansible_distribution": "Ubuntu",
        "ansible_distribution_version": "20.04",
        "ansible_memfree_mb": 127,
        "ansible_memtotal_mb": 3933,
        "ansible_processor_cores": 2,
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false
}
10.0.1.120 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
        "ansible_distribution": "Ubuntu",
        "ansible_distribution_version": "18.04",
        "ansible_memfree_mb": 134,

    },

}








Example 2: 

$ ansible linux -m setup 'filter=ansible_distribution,ansible_distribution_version,ansible_memfree_mb,ansible_memtotal_mb,ansible_processor_cores*,ansible_architecture' 2>/dev/null
