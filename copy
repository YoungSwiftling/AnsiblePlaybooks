# Copy

# The copy module allows you to copy a file from the Ansible control node to the target hosts. In addition to copying the file, it allows you to set ownership, permissions, to the destination file. Here’s an example of using the copy module to copy a “message of the day” configuration file to the target hosts:

---
- hosts: web 
  user: root
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file with owner and permissions
      copy:
        src: ./filesend2.txt
        dest: /Downloads
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
