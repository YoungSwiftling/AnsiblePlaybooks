# While working with EC2 Linux instances there could be a requirement to get the list of all the machines which had not been rebooted over months or for a particular number of days.The reason could be for audit or to the check the status of instances.

# I have put together tasks to accomplish it as an Ansible Playbook below.
# Assumptions

# You have an working Ansible environment with a proper inventory file with all the details of hosts being managed.
# Script

- name: Get the list of all the nodes which are running over a month
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:

      - name: Show hostname for sanity check (or just use -v flag for verbose)
        command: hostname
        register: hostname
      - debug: var=hostname.stdout_lines

      - name: Check uptime prior reboot
        shell: cut -d ' ' -f1 /proc/uptime
        register: UPTIME_PRE_REBOOT

      - name: Setting fact for number of days
        set_fact:
          uptime_days: "{ { (UPTIME_PRE_REBOOT.stdout | int / 86400) | round(0) } }"

      - name: Hosts to be rebooted.
        debug:
          msg: " has not been rebooted since  days,which is older than a month"
        when: (uptime_days | int) > 30





# Example 2:  ansible ad hoc command to check uptime

# In this example, we are going to know the uptime of the hosts. Ansible provides two major modules to run the command over the host group or on the remote server.

# Which one to pick is not a big confusion if you know what are they and their capabilities
# FAQ: Ansible command vs shell module

# Here are the commands you can use to get the uptime. All three commands would yield you the same results.

ansible multi -m command -a uptime 
ansible multi -m shell -a uptime 
ansible multi -a uptime
