<!-- ad hoc command to Start or stop the service

You really do not have to log in to start or stop the service running in your Linux system. you can simply use this ansible service module ad hoc command -->

# To Start a Service
ansible multi -s -m service -a "name=httod state=started enabled=yes"

# To Stop a Service
ansible multi -s -m service -a "name=httpd state=stop enabled=yes"














# Example 2:  ansible ad hoc command to check uptime

# ad hoc command to stop, start, restart service - Ansible SystemD

# Simple way to restart any service with Ansible ad hoc command is to use Shell module with the actual service or systemctl command

$ ansible webservers -m shell -a "service nginx restart" -b
$ ansible webservers -m shell -a "systemctl restart nginx" -b

# You can also use Ansible's built in systemd module otherwise like this.
$ ansible webservers  -m systemd -a "name=nginx state=reloaded" -i prod-ansible-hosts
$ ansible webservers -m systemd -a "name=nginx state=restarted" -i prod-ansible-hosts
$ ansible webservers -m systemd -a "name=nginx state=started" -i prod-ansible-hosts
$ ansible webservers -m systemd -a "name=nginx state=stopped" -i prod-ansible-hosts

# So this is how you can manage to start, stop , restart services using ansible ad hoc
